# Configuration Element: Clean Commands 

### What is it for?
This setting controls whether or not some command (mainly commands that get high usage or where the response is mostly indicating "Yes, it worked!") responses are removed after a few seconds.\
This is useful for keeping your channels clean!
   
### Usage
Set up clean commands using `.config clean on/off/toggle`

### Accepted Inputs
Either `on`, `off` or `toggle`

üìù **Note:** Configuration errors will not be deleted.
