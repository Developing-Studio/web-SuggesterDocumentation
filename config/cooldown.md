# Configuration Element: Suggestion Cooldown 

### What is it for?
This element defines the time users must wait before being able to suggest again.

### Usage
Configure the cooldown using `.config cooldown [time]`

### Accepted Inputs
Use `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, `h` for hours and `d` for days.


?> Staff & Admin members are exempted from this cooldown and therefore do not need to wait between suggestions.
