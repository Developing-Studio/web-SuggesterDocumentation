### What is it for?
This setting defines what role users will be given when they have a suggestion approved.

### Usage
Set up an approve role using `.config approverole [role]`

âš  **Warning!** Integration roles such as bots', boosting or Twitch/YouTube subs as well as `@everyone` cannot be given and thus are unable to be set as an approve role
