# Editing a suggestion
Mistakes happen, if your grammar decides to randomly take a nap when suggesting something, you can now fix it using the new and shiny `edit` command! 

### Users
Regular users can only edit their own approved suggestion(s). If the mode is set to `review`, any edit will require review by a staff member unless it is edited by someone with staff/admin perms

### Staff & Admins
Users with staff or admin permissions can edit any suggestion, without needing approval. If the suggestion has been edited by a server staff member, it will displayed along their username on the suggestion embed

### Usage
Use `.edit [suggestion ID] (new content)` in any channel the bot can read & send messages in

### Arguments

`suggestion ID`: The ID of the suggestion you’d like to edit. If you don't have staff/admin perms, you can only edit your own suggestions\
`new content`: The new version of the suggestion
