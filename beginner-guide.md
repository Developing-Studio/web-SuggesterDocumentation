# Beginner's Guide: How to start using Suggester? {docsify-ignore-all}
---
You've ever wanted an awesome discord bot suiting all your needs and giving away free cookies? Well, Suggester only allows the former (good news, I guess?).. Okay, let's start. It can look a bit complicated at first, but don't fret we'll dive into it below!

First, you need to add Suggester to your server, you can do so with [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=564426594144354315&scope=bot&permissions=805694544) (you'll need the **Manage Server** permission on the server you'd like to add the bot). Suggester needs all permissions shown to function correctly, if any of these permissions are omitted, some functions may not work.

When you're done filling that annoying captcha, go back to your server. Suggester should've sent a handy tutorial with some information about configuration, what a good introduction to what's next! Suggester uses a modern configuration system which allows admins to customize its behavior in each server, that being said, you now need to setup the bot in your server. There's two different ways to do that, the first one doesn't require anything but the usage of a command: send `.autosetup` in any channel the bot can read & send messages in then let the magic happen! More information about automatic setup can be found [here](admin/autosetup.md).
If you wish to do it yourself, you can use the  second way will guide

## **Step 2: Configure the Bot**
In order for the bot to work, it must be configured. There are three ways to setup the bot, [autosetup](admin/autosetup.md), a wizard-like [setup](admin/setup.md) and a fully manual [config](admin/config.md).

## **Step 3: Get suggesting!**
You can now use the [suggest](all/suggest.md) command to submit suggestions!
