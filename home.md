# Official Suggester Documentation {docsify-ignore-all}
---
Suggester is an [open source](https://github.com/Suggester/Suggester) Discord bot helping staff members & admins to manage feedback in their server, with the usage of a modern suggestion system and its granular configuration elements. On this site, we have documented all Suggester commands, telling you how to use each of them.

All sections in these docs will use the bot's default prefix, which is currently `.` (a dot, woah). You can change it at anytime using the [config](/config/configuration.md) command, and more precisely by redefining the [Prefix](/config/prefix.md) element.

In this documentation, arguments surrounded by [square brackets] are __required__ while arguments surrounded by (parenthesis) are __optional__.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask us in our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/G5pEdUp)! Don't worry, we don't bite :)
