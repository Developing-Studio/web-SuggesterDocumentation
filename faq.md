# Suggester FAQ
You will find below a summary of questions we often see asked, if your question isn't answered here, join our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/G5pEdUp) and ask!

### Will kicking and adding Suggester back help in fixing my issue?
Most likely not, as settings stay stored even if the bot is kicked and re-added. If you're having an issue, contact our Support Team and we'll look into it further.

### Suggester isn't responding in my server, what can I do?
Check the bot's permissions in the channel you're attempting to use commands in, it must be able to **read and send messages** in order to respond. 
If it does have correct perms, make sure you're using the right prefix, it is configurable per-server so it may have been changed.\
Do note that you can always use the bot mention as a prefix (`Suggester#8366`), if none of the above solved your issue, let us know in our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/G5pEdUp)!

### How to find a comment's ID?
Some commands will use a comment's ID as an argument. To find the ID of a comment, look at its field name, it will be displayed after the comment author's tag (if the comment is anonymous, it will be shown after ''Staff Comment'').
A comment's ID is formed by the ID of the suggestion its on followed by `_` and the number of total comments on this suggestion.\
**Example ID:** `12345_1`

### I found a bug, how do I report it?

### How do I set a locale?

Suggester offers many different locales, so you can choose what language the bot will use when you'll use it! Locales can be configured on a per-user and per-server basis.

- To configure your User locale, use the `.locales` command to see the list of all available languages. Find the one you want, then use `.locale [name]` to set it!
- To configure your Server locale, use the [`.config locale`](/config/locale.md) command to see all available languages. Find the one you want, then use `.config locale [name]` to set it!

If your language isn't there and you want to translate it, take a look at our [Translation Program](commmunity-programs.md)
